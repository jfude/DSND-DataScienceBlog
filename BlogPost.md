# The Where, When, and How Much of AirBnB in Seattle

Wherever there is a growing and thriving city, you can bet that AirBnB, the rental facilator that owns no rental properties, 
will be there. Today there is probably no better example of this symbiosis than Seattle WA. According to the US Census Bureau,  Seattle now holds the distinction of being the fastest growing US city over the last decade. Lonely Planet, one of the largest publishers of guidebooks and travel apps, designated the city the 8th top destination for world travelers in 2019.

Apart from visitor attractions like the recently expanded Pike Place Market, a newly refurbished Space Needle, world class restaurants, volcanos, and hiking opportunities away from the city, Seattle also attracts its fair share of new residents for business. Amazon HQ is ever more visible with its recent spherical office installations. (more here,picture)


With this rapid growth, an equally fast rise in demand for temporary rentals has been satiated by AirBnB offerings.

In this article, we'll take a look at the data to address questions that would be of interest to both 
the corporate and renter sides of the business.

For the upcoming year where will be the most/least expensive AirBnB listings in Seattle and how will
prices change throughout the year.

For the average renter, will it pay to book early?

What are the leading factors that determine price for an AirBnB rental?

What is the potential profitability for the upcoming year?


### Where will be the most/least expensive AirBnB listings in Seattle. How will
### prices change throughout the year?

For this study we used AirBnB year long calendar listings that begin roughly in mid-September 2019.
A box quartile plot of the prices vs 17 Seattle neighborhoods shows that around the mean nighly price of 
about $100 all neighborhoods overlap significantly. Clear differences are brought out however when we divide prices into
four ranges.

Low       price < $75
Normal    $75   < price < $500
High      $500  < price < $1200
Extremely $1200 < price 


The following four plots show the ratio of the number listings in a neighborhood for the price range to the number of all listings for that neighborhood. The most represented neighborhoods on the high end are Seward Park, Queen Anne, and Magnolia. 
Queen Anne homes, some historic, with views and/or access to Lake Union top the list for those that can afford $3000/night and more. Note how these areas move steadily down from the most to the least represented neighborhoods proportionately with price.   
Areas of North/North East Seattle and Beacon Hill show the opposite trend and NorthGate is most represented on the low end of prices.


To look at average prices over time, we again divide the listings into the four ranges. While prices in all ranges show that weekends are more expensive than weekends, only the normal range of prices shows seasonality. Prices are highest in the summer,
and increases during holidays and particularly the Christmas season are evident (desgnated on plot).


### For the average renter, does it pay to book early?

In order to address this question, we need to consider AirBnB calendar listings posted at different times. We compared rental prices from snapshots of the calendar roughly a half year and one month previous to the rental date. The plots below show the 
distribution of price differences for rentals less than $400 per night. For about 40% of all listings in this time frame, we found no change in price. A plot of the distribution of listings with non-zero price differences is shown below. Evidently, you are just as likely to save from booking late as opposed to booking early. 


### What are the leading factors that determine price for an AirBnB rental?

As we saw above, location has some affect on the price of rentals away from the mean, and close to the mean time of year
is generally important. Travellers comparing options will of course want to know what other factors affect price.
